# Exploring Biases in Vision Privacy Protection Techniques

In recent years machine learning has become a common
part of technology and society. With the integration of
these models in to applications, it is essential to
encompass a plethora of data reflective of the
population. However, machine learning models are not
easy to tailor for a variety of demographics so issues with
bias, fairness, and accountability arise.We wanted to understand how **biases in computer
vision techniques can affect the pervasiveness of social
media-based privacy leaks**. To mitigate privacy leaks on
social media, we proposed a computer vision system to
identify content and mitigation techniques to reduce
exposure of social media network users. Th
